# Intro

I get a kick out of well-done covers. Today I was listening to Lacuna Coils' version of Enjoy the silence and thought "I should make a list of all the cool ones I encounter"... so here it is, my list of cool covers of otherwise mundane songs. The list is in no particular order, but I did split it up in Metal songs vs Other songs.

I also just started the list, so it will expand over time.

# Metal covers of pop songs

  - [Lacuna Coil - Enjoy the Silence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lx58hXh4pVA)
  - [Norther - Final Countdown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNvRMBqqvrs)
  - [Disturbed - Sound of Silence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9Dg-g7t2l4)
  
# Pop songs done proper

  - [Major to Minor: "All I Want For Christmas Is You" by Chase Holfelder & Kurt Hugo Schneider](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQrN9ba8qEM)

# Outro

I hope you enjoyed the list. If you have suggestions for the list, then drop me a line on twitter ([@credmp](https://twitter.com/credmp)).
