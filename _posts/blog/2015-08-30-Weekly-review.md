## Clojure universe

As of august 25th [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) will provide [Instant Answers](http://www.clojure.tn/posts/25-08-2015-Clojure-IA-DDG.html) for any query containing `clojure`.

David Nolen gave yet another awesome presentation on [ClojureScript in Action!](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/clojurescript-web-ios?utm_campaign=infoq_content&utm_source=infoq&utm_medium=feed&utm_term=global).

A new book was published; [Clojure data structures and algorithms](http://www.clojure.tn/posts/20-08-2015-clojure-data-algos-book.html). I have not read it, but if you did, let me know how it is!

Interesting posts
