Tomorrow will mark my 1 year anniversary with running. I [started running]({{site.urel}}/2014/01/26/running-0-to-10km-in-6-months)  after I saw a group of colleagues finish the 7km in a business run for the <a href="http://almerecityrun.com" title="Almere City Run" target="_blank">Almere City Run</a> (ACR). Today was the 2014 edition of the ACR and I participated in the 14km run.

I trained for this event for 1 year and so for me it was a big deal. Not everything went according to plan however. Somehow they misplaced the bag with all our starter numbers, which meant the organisation had to make some last minute numbers available to us. Sadly all these numbers had other people's names on them. I guess they were the no-shows. So I had to run under the name Kimberley... This was quite hilarious amongst ourselves, but in all it is quite annoying if such a fundamental part of the run is just not according to plan.

On the 14km I had a partner in crime, my buddy Rob, who helped me pace the run. Rob has finished [Ironman 70.3 in Mallorca](http://www.ironman.com/triathlon/events/emea/ironman-70.3/mallorca.aspx) and will continue to rock on as he will become a full <a href="http://www.ironman.com/triathlon/events/emea/ironman/switzerland.aspx" title="Ironman Zurch" target="_blank">Ironman in Zurich</a> this summer. So huge props to him for keeping me up on my pace.

The race started quite fantastic. We were some of the last people leaving the starting line. This meant we had to overtake a whole lot of people, more then 500 to be exact. We finished 164th out of 685 starters. The course was quite familiar of course. First through the city center, next on to my usual route along the leeghwater plassen followed by a long run along the canal. From there we turned into the woods and all was good.

I met the man with the hamer at kilometer 11. Luckily Rob pulled me through it and we didn't loose too much time. Sadly we could not complete our planned negative splits. The last 2km went quite steady, along the weerwater and through the LumierÄ— park. We finished in 1:12:19, which is an absolute best for me! Up to now the farthest distance I had run at full speed was 10km, so 14km is a big deal for me!

Afterwards I celebrated with my colleagues and my wife who all had finished their races. On the 7km race we won the business run again, same as last year, and our company will have a beautiful trophy in the foyer again.

So all in all it was a great closing of a year of running. From now on I will be moving onward to the half marathon in Oktober!
