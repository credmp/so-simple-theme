<p>On may 18th I ran in the town of Leeuwarden in an event called <a href="http://loopleeuwarden.nl" title="Loop Leeuwarden" target="_blank">Loop Leeuwarden</a>. I actually grew up in Leeuwarden, so for me it was a nice old-hometown run. We dropped our kid off at my mom's and proceeded into the city center, where the large area in front of the Oldehove was converted into start and finish area. </p>

<p>Mother nature decided that we would start the summer just that weekend. From lot temperatures of 13C to 15C the temperature jumped to 25C with a very bright sun. I started off the weekend by buying a running cap to save me from the sun a little bit. I did not have any training in high temperatures however, so that would be very interesting.</p>

<p>There were lots of stands and even the army, which has a large presence in Leeuwarden, was present to demonstrate exercises and show off their tanks.</p>
<p>The route took off from the city center and moved north into the green area surrounding it. From there we circled back along the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elfstedentocht" title="Ee canal" target="_blank">famous Ee</a> canal. Back in the city we went over the shopping streets where lots of people were sitting in front of pubs and other drinking establishments.</p>

<p>The start was quite something. Even though you had to give a time you were expected to finish when registering, there were not starting areas based on time. First there was an area for invited runners, second for the business runners and lastly an area for other people, like myself. One thing to note is that business runners (where a company registers them) are generally slower, so in front of the recreational runners there was a very large group of slower runners.</p>

<p>Sadly that meant that the start was very messy, lots of people trying to overtake the slower runners in narrow areas and even a few falling runners shaking up the pack. Luckily everybody survived the start and after about 3 kilometers I found a good spot to run.</p>
<p>The heat actually got to me at about 7 kilometer and I had to slow down. I was actually on track to run my first sub 50 minute 10 kilometer, but the heat kept me from running the pace. I ended up running 51:08 on the 10 kilometer and placed 231th of 1378 runners. The full race is viewable on Garmin Connect via the widget below.</p>
