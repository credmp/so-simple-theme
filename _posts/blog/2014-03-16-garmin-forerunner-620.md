<h1>Bugs</h1>
<h2>Solved</h2>
<p>With each firmware update Garmin fixes more and more issues. I will update the list below with the fixes that have affected me.</p>
<h3>WiFi</h3>
<p>I had a wireless network on the unsupported channels, I had to change the channel of the network itself to allow the watch to use it. Even though it could see it now, the wifi sync only worked every once in a while. The Garmin Forum has a <a href="https://forums.garmin.com/showthread.php?65983-Update-Forerunner-620-Wi-Fi-Troubleshooting-Assistance" title="Forerunner 620 Wi-Fi Troubleshooting Assistance" target="_blank">long thread</a> on WiFi connection problems.</p>
<p>Since firmware 2.60 this issue has been resolved.</p>
