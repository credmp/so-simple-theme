<p>One of the cooler things you can do once you own a Garmin ForeRunner, or most other Garmin watches for that matter, is creating workouts. </p>
<p>After I finished <a href="http://www.wickeddutch.com/2014/01/26/running-0-to-10km-in-6-months/" title="Running 0 to 10km in 6 months">Evy's 10km plan</a> I went looking for new challenges. I entered myself in the 14km race in the <a href="http://almerecityrun.com/" target="_blank">Almere City Run</a>. I also started looking into good ways to train without overdoing it. It turns out that just running really fast is not that good for you. </p>
<p>By running at a lower pace and performing interval training you can <a href="http://www.active.com/running/articles/why-distance-runners-need-interval-training" target="_blank">achieve higher speeds and eventually you can run more</a> because you are not overreaching. Based on this feedback from one of my colleagues I went looking for a training plan that would help me through the winter. I ended up with a 15km plan by Sportzorg. You can download various <a href="http://www.sportzorg.nl/schema/" target="_blank">sportzorg training schedules</a> from the website.</p>
<p>When you own a <a href="http://sites.garmin.com/forerunner610/" target="_blank">Garmin ForeRunner 610</a> watch like I do, it is fun to program these workouts into your watch. Lets create one as an example. Basically you start with a schedule as shown below.</p>
<p><img src="assets/Screen-Shot-2014-02-04-at-22.01.10.png" alt="W10 Schedule" width="807" height="179" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-724" /></p>
<p>With this, using the <a href="http://connect.garmin.com" title="Garmin Connect" target="_blank">Garmin Connect</a> website, we will create a new workout. First you press <strong>add step</strong> and select <strong>Warm Up</strong>. Set the time for about 10 minutes. It is a warm up to the hard part of the run, so let your heart rate slowly rise to the desired 160 for the interval part. Next you add a <strong>Repeat</strong> section, for this exercise you select to do the repeat 5 times. In the repeat we add the steps for a 3 minute <strong>Interval</strong> in the high heart rates and the 2 minute <strong>Recovery</strong>. Afterwards there will be a 10 minute <strong>Cool Down</strong> period. </p>
<p>When you are finished with the above steps, the workout is complete. The image below shows the workout.</p>
<p><img src="assets/Screen-Shot-2014-02-04-at-21.57.36.png" alt="Garmin Workout" width="680" height="383" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-722" /></p>
<p>Now, when you start your workout on the watch you will see that the watch tells you which section you are doing and within which heart rates you need to be for that particular section. When your heart rate is either too low or too high it will warn you. When you need to switch between warm up, interval, recovery or cool down the watch will vibrate and tell you what you need to do. </p>
<p>The workout referenced by the watch below is slightly different from the one we just programmed, but it proves the point nevertheless.</p>

<p>Within Garmin Connect the splits overview will tell you the speeds you achieved on each section. The below image shows some of the splits from an earlier workout I did. You can see the 10 minute warm up followed by, in total, 8 repeats of a 1 minute interval and a 2 minute recovery time.</p>

<p>I hope you found this article helpful. Other people have helped me get to grips with the possibilities of the sports tech that I use and I think it is only fair to pay it forward. Happy running!</p>
