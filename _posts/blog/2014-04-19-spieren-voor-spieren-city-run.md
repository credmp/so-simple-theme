<p>It has been way too long that I wrote here. Life has caught up to me in that work has been hectic, I've been trying to work on my school projects and of course my personal life takes the necessary time. But on April 6th I ran another race, so a quick report is in place!</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.spierenvoorspierencityrun.nl/" title="Spieren voor Spieren city run" target="_blank">Spieren voor Spieren city run</a> took place in the city of Hilversum. It is one of the largest city runs in The Netherlands.</p>
<p>In my category, the 10km, about 2100 people participated, by far the most people I have seen in any of my runs. Luckily I was pretty far out in front of the field, but nevertheless it became very difficult to get into a good rythm in the first few kilometers. This is very visible in the statistics from my Garmin, the Ground Contact Time (the time spent on the ground while running) shows that it took over 8 1/2 minutes to get into the zone...</p>

<p>The course went through the <a href="http://mediapark.nl/" title="Mediapark">Mediapark</a>, which basically is the area in which all the TV stations have their studios. Next the course winded through various suburbs and the city centre. </p>
<p>The suburbs were pretty awesome! Many people were supporting us along the track, several kids had even created their own water stands to help the runners out.</p>
<p>The last few kilometers went through the city centre. The road was packed with people, at one point I thought it felt like a course in the tour de france!</p>
<p>Pretty much the most awesome race up to now, again setting a personal record of 51:29 on the 10KM! That is an average of 5:09 min/km.</p>
<h2>Rexona</h2>
<p>Rexona sponsored the event, one very interesting they did was to place camera's on the track to automatically take pictures of the runners. My picture is shown below:</p>

<p>A video of the run was also created, however I found that I was barely visible on it, so it would be more like watching a bunch of people run if I posted a link here.</p>
<h2>Garmin Connect</h2>
<p>Lets take a look at some of the stats my watch recorded:</p>
<p>First lets take a look at the elevation of the course. As you see it was kinda hilly with differences of up to 20 meters.</p>
<p><img src="assets/SvS-Elevation.png" alt="SvS Elevation" width="914" height="439" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-927" /></p>
<p>I really did not notice the elevation differences as I was focused on running within a particular timeframe. I set my watch to alert me if my pace went faster of slower then 5:00 min/km - 5:20 min/km. As a result I ran a very flat race:</p>

<p>In hindsight I could've gone faster on the descent and slower on the ascend, but it worked for me!</p>
<p>As you might've noticed I have gained access to the 'modern' garmin connect! Here is a full page screenshot of the entire page:</p>
<p><img src="assets/Garmin-Connect-512x1024.png" alt="Garmin Connect" width="512" height="1024" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-929" /></p>
<p>Many people complain about the Modern page, however I find it very useful up to now! Especially the new reports section is quite an improvement! I will post an in-depth review when I can. </p>
<h2>Other races</h2>
<p>I have registered for several other races:</p>
