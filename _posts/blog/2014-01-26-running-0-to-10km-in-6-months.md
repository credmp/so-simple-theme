<p>On December 1st, 2013, I ran my first 10km race. I finished the race in an official time of 54 minutes 21 seconds. This was a major milestone for me personally as 6 months before I was not able to run more then 5 minutes at a stretch without exhausting myself. I want to share my journey that has made it possible for me to actually run 10km in under 1 hour.</p>
<p>It all started when a group of my colleagues, some of whom I thought I would never see run, finished a 7km business run in the <a href="http://almerecityrun.com" title="Almere City Run" target="_blank">Almere City Run</a>. They had professional training in the weeks prior to the event. After seeing that they could finish a 7km run I said to myself "I can do that too!". </p>
<p>My wife introduced me to <a href="http://rennenmetevy.nl" title="Rennen met Evy" target="_blank">Rennen met Evy</a>, which is a podcast from Belgium. In it <a href="http://www.evygruyaert.be" title="Evy Gruyaert" target="_blank">Evy Gruyeart</a> helps you through a series of 30 run/walk sessions. Each session you push your boundaries by running more and walking less.</p>
<p>June 18th, 2 days after the event I started training. I finished the 5km program and continued on to the 10km portion of the podcast. In all fairness I did not start with lesson 1. As I previously had dabbled with running I figured I could manage a whopping 5 minute run from the start. </p>
<p>I have a very busy live. I have a small child, a 50+ hour job and 2 night classes on monday and thursday. Lots of reasons to find excuses not to workout really. Once you decide you want to get fit you just need to commit to it. Since I couldn't find any time during the day and evening portion of my workweek I decided to get up earlier. I would set my alarm for 6 am and get up an hour earlier then normal. The key in all of this is to just <strong>never quit!</strong></p>
<p>On december 1st my first official race would be the <a href="http://www.tvalmere.nl/over-triathlon-vereniging-almere/kromslootparkloop/" target="_blank">kromslootparkloop</a>. It is a very small local race with only a few hundred contestants. No match for the larger races of course. The course went through the Kromslootpark and followed a hardend path until it reached the water. There we ran over the outside of a dike to a turning point at which we turned around and did the entire course in reverse.</p>

<p>I was surprised by the start section of the race. The many people around you make that I got really excited and as a result the first section I ran way too fast. The point here is to always be sure you run your own race and not to get drawn into a much higher pace due to the crowd.</p>
<p>I failed to do a proper pre-start check of my equipment. I ran with my iPhone and earbuds. When I started my music was acting up, and runkeeper was inaudible. It turns out the plug was not properly into the phone. When I fixed it my music stopped playing. I did not bother fixing it, as that would mean I would not be focussed on running. So it was also my first 10km without music.</p>
<p>Along the course several people were taking pictures, one of them shared a photo with me on it. As you can see I was holding up really well, this shot would be around the 9km marker. I am the guy in front. You can see the white cord of the earbuds, but no sound was coming through them.</p>

<p>Crossing the finish line was quite something. A small crowd was still cheering people on and to have someone call out your name and then people cheer because it is you, is quite bad-ass!</p>
<p>Since then I changed a few things, I no longer run with music playing and I changed my iPhone out for a running watch, a <a href="http://sites.garmin.com/forerunner610/?lang=en" target="_blank">Garmin Forerunner 610</a>. If you are interested in the watch I can highly recommend the <a href="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/2011/04/garmin-forerunner-610-in-depth-review.html" target="_blank">in-depth review by DC Rainmaker</a>. I still use my iPhone on training sessions so I can have live tracking (via runkeeper) of my exercise, but for registration I rely on my watch now.</p>
<p>In januari 2014 my wife and I decided go and run an event every month. We booked events up until june, at that time we will run the Almere City Run! On februari 8th I will run my second event, the <a href="http://www.cbfb.nl/februariloop" target="_blank">Bennekomse Februariloop</a>, through the forrest of Ede/Bennekom.</p>
