<p>At the beginning of the year my wife and I entered ourselves into several races. For each month we have a race planned up until june. In june I will run my first 14km run and she will run her first 7km run. Up to that point my longest race distance will be the 10km.</p>
<p>The first race I did this year was the <a href="http://www.cbfb.nl/februariloop" target="_blank">Februariloop in Bennekom</a>. In this post I want to give you some insight into how I experienced this race.</p>
<p>Most smaller races here do not send your starting number to your house. So on raceday you get there a little earlier and you pick it up at a special desk. As this was a race of about 1000 participants it was also the case here. Last year the same race had 500 participants, so they expanded very rapidly. The long lines at the pickup were evidence of this. It was very cozy and a very friendly atmosphere, but quite a long wait.</p>
<p>The packet that I received had my starting number, an <a href="http://www.ipicosports.com/" target="_blank">Ipico chip</a>, some pins and a tie-rip.<br />
o<br />

<p>The tie-rip is meant to connect the chip to your shoe. As it was new to me, I investigated the chip earlier and found a video detailing how you can just lace the chip with your normal shoelaces. So I just did that instead of using the tie-tip. I feared it would otherwise just flap around while running and by lacing it there was a very snug fit.</p>
<p><img src="assets/IMG_2309-2.jpg" alt="The chip" width="1024" height="768" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-748" /></p>
<p>While running I frequently had my shoelaces coming undone. This is quite a pain when you are in your zone. On <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/running/" target="_blank">/r/running</a> someone shared a photo of themselves running a cross, with shoelaces tucked aways under itself. This trick keeps them from coming undone and since then I have been doing it as well.</p>
<p>It then came to explore the course and the grounds. I registered for a 5km run, as I am very unfamiliar with running in the woods, hills and sandy terrains. In hindsight I am very happy with my conservative choice! The course is detailed below. You see the hill formation in the height profile below the map. As you see the first part of it was all uphill, then a run downhill only to have a nasty quick climb again just before the finish.</p>
<p>The area where the race was being held was in fact the grounds of <a href="http://kasteelhoekelum.nl/" target="_blank">a castle</a>! This made it quite unique I think.</p>

<p>On the grounds there were several bands playing. There were also small tents where you could get a t-shirt or something to eat. Most people instead just used the grounds to warm-up and talk to eachother.</p>

<p>The start / finish area was located at the start of the woods. It was not very wide, so the area itself was quite long to fit all the people for the race. In total there were 268 runners for the 5km. Interestingly they seem to have turned around the sign of the start/finish. So you start looking at the finish sign and you end looking at the start sign. Somebody was not really awake in the morning :). </p>

<p>In the race itself I thought I died. The start was as you would expect. It was narrow and a lot of people, so I started running along with the lead pack. They had a much higher tempo then what I was used to. After a few hunderd meters I looked at my watch and found the pace to be around 5min/km. I slowed down a little bit to prevent myself from blowing up. It started raining somewhat as soon as we left the starting line. I must say that I hardly noticed, only when I needed to wipe the water off of my watch really.</p>
<p>The roads initially were quite nice; a well packed dirt road without any mud. Here and there some water was pooled up from the rain the last couple of days, but besides that it was quite easy going. I got in the pace of a 5:10min/km run. That all changed at about 1.6km. We entered the woods and started following hiking trails. With the recent downpour the trails had become a pool of mud about ankle high. People were trying to stay clear by walking on the sides of the path. I actually slipped a few times as well, luckily nobody actually fell over. The pace started dropping rapidly. Overtaking slow people was nearly impossible so the speed at points dropped to 7:30min/km. Luckily, at the 2.7km point we left the dirt trails and once again were running on mostly solid grounds.</p>
<p>With the exit of the woods we also started downhill again. After the climb it was a welcome change of pace. It was time to make up for the lost time in the woods by running a 4:56min kilometer, a personal fastest up to now. The last 1.5km were once again through the woods, only now over well taken care of service roads. Around me I saw a lot of people whom clearly were exhausted from running through the woods and downhill, they started walking to catch their breath. One stranger that clung to me as I passed her needed a little encouragement, so I told her it was only 500 meters left to go and counted down every last 100 meters for her. It seemed to help and I feel I did a good deed at that time.</p>
<p>The last 100 meters I felt I had something left, so I pushed out a little sprint. According to the GPS it went in 3:51min/km. The official time for my run was 27:14 with an average of 5:26min/km. With my Garmin watch I tracked it right on the money, so my Garmin run exactly reflects the official metered time.</p>
<p>As I said there was a lot of mud. I tried to take a picture that shows this. In hindsight I figure I should've just gone back into the woods to make a picture of the mud, but for now a picture of my muddy running shoes will have to do.</p>

<p>All in all the race was awesome! My next race is in 20 days in the city of Leeuwarden.</p>
