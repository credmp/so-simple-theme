<p>On march 7th it was my birthday. As customary with birthdays I received several presents. The first was a Garmin Footpod and the second a trip to the city of Maastricht. Lets take a look at the Garmin Footpod in this post.</p>
<h2>Garmin Footpod</h2>
<p>A footpod is a sensor that you attach to your shoelaces. Over at <a href="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/2011/01/garmin-ant-foot-pods-everything-you.html" title="DC Rainmaker" target="_blank">DC Rainmaker</a> there is a long article detailing all you ever wanted to know about footpods. Basically it looks as follows:</p>
<p><img src="assets/footpod.jpg" alt="footpod" width="300" height="300" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-875" /></p>
<p>You attach it to your shoe and on your Forerunner 620 you go into your system settings and add a sensor (footpod). From then on the watch will take the data from the sensor into account. But why would you need it? The forerunner does an awesome job of taking care of so many statistics, so why an additional device? Well, basically getting the current pace from GPS is kinda slow in the watch. Perhaps it is a firmware thing, but the below 2 videos from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/Landorrun" title="Landorrun" target="_blank">Landorrun</a> show the effect of the footpod.</p>

<p>As you see, with GPS it takes a while to get back to the real tempo. This is very annoying when performing interval runs, as you never have the right tempo on the watch when changing between paces. Now take a look when a footpod is added to the mix:</p>

<p>Putting this to the test gave some interesting results. I have workouts with intervals programmed into my watch. Each interval switches to a screen with the pace and the time needed. Interestingly it is not the lap pace that seems to be displayed here, so it is not correct. I found I had to switch to another screen displaying the current lap pace to get the right result. I have to perform some more tests, but if my results stick I will file a bug report.</p>
<p>Yesterday Garmin released firmware 2.6, so I will see if it is fixed in it.</p>
<h2>Maastricht</h2>
<p>The second gift was a weekend in the city of maastricht. We went on a nice 70 minute slow (140 bpm) run.</p>
<p><img src="assets/Maastricht-Route.png" alt="Maastricht Route" width="633" height="322" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-882" /></p>
<p>We ran past old castles.</p>

<p>Along the river 'Maas' on which row boats were training.</p>

<p>Over 2 of the 4 bridges connecting both parts of the city.</p>

<p>And back to the old inner city which still has the old city walls.</p>

<p>All in all a beautiful city with lots of possibilities to go for a run!</p>
<h2>Training</h2>
<p>It has been nearly 2 weeks since <a href="http://www.wickeddutch.com/2014/03/02/race-report-rondje-goutum/" title="Race report: Rondje Goutum" target="_blank">my race report on Rondje Goutum</a>. Since then I did the following training runs:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Tuesday 6am, 40 minutes in Zone 2</dt>
<dd>A slow run in heart rate zone 2.</dd>
<dt>Thursday 6:30 pm, 9 intervals at 4:45 min/km</dt>
<dd>An intense set of intervals at 4:45 min/km. I find the first few to be ok, but after the 4th it gets really hard.</dd>
<dt>Saturday, 70 minutes at 140 bpm</dt>
<dd>Running around Maastricht with an heart rate of 140 bpm. Together with my wife we spent 70 minutes exploring the banks of the Maas.</dd>
<dt>Tuesday 6am, 5 km progressive</dt>
<dd>The first training of the sort. Each kilometer has to be done faster then the last one. I set out at a pace of 6 min/km and finished at 5:00 min/km, each time increasing the pace with 10 seconds or so. Turns out is quite hard to pace yourselves.</dd>
<dt>Friday 6pm, 10 intervals at 4:45 min/km</dt>
<dd>The intervals are becoming easier. I find that I can now easily do 6 intervals before starting to feel it in my legs.</dd>
