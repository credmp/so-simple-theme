<p>This weekend was something special. As you know, last friday was valentine's day and as a gift I gave The Wife a weekend away from home. I had arranged for The Kid to sleep over at the grandparents and as such we would have a long weekend together for the first time in centuries!</p>
<p>The hotel I found was <a href="http://www.prinsenhof-groningen.nl/hotel" target="_blank">Hotel Prinsenhof</a>. It was absolutely stunning! The room was spacious and the people were very kind and professional. I wholeheartedly would recommend it to anyone!</p>

<p>One of the special moments during this trip was on sunday. For the first time ever The Wife and I would run together through Groningen. I previously had picked out a route to match her training schedule. A 40 minute run at about 8 minutes per kilometer. So that would amount to a 5k run.</p>

<p>I figured we would just follow the outer rim of the old city center for this. As most old towns the old center has a canal around it to guard against invading armies and such. At the beginning of the route we would make a small diversion and head into the Prinsentuin for a run around the park before continuing back on the route around the city center.</p>
<p>If you look at the registered route below you see that it didn't really go according to the plan. We kinda went the wrong way when returning from the park, also we did a much longer portion of the park as I had previously measured.</p>

<p>Normally I run through a runner's friendly part of my hometown of Almere. So running in an old city, Groningen has history dating back to 1040 ad as its first written reference, has some of its own problems. The most notable I found to be the traffic lights. </p>

<p>Luckily, after a few of them we got into an area which was more runner friendly, the park. First we had to cross the canal that circles the old city center. Here you can also see that the canal is lined with large boats that are used to traffic different types of goods. Further down there were also boats on which people live. Basically they transformed the boats to houses.</p>

<p>The park was basically like any other park, lots of green with well taken care of pathways. One of the more fun elements was a nice little hill. I took the route up the hill while The Wife took the route around the hill. It was a fun little climb that gave my muscles quite a little workout.</p>

<p>A little ways further down we found a small pond. One runner was doing exercises in the area. I figure the steps make for a good stretch if you want one.</p>

<p>After exiting the park we took a wrong turn. luckily we found out in time and we circled back through the city center to still stick with the program and complete a 40 minute, 5k workout.</p>
<p>It was quite something special to be able to run together. I really enjoyed it and I hope we get to do it again soon.</p>
