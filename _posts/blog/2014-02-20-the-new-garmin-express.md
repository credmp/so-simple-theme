<p>Yesterday Garmin switched over their website to the new look and feel. They announced that a <a href="http://garmin.blogs.com/my_weblog/2014/01/ces-announcement-garmin-connect-redesign-.html#.UwWovkJdUnV" target="_blank">major revamp</a> was coming at the last CES conference and this is the first step. </p>
<p>One of the other changes is that they will ditch the current ANT Helper application for their new and improved Garmin Express. When you press the <a href="http://connect.garmin.com/en-US/start/" target="_blank">Get Started</a> button it will actually tell you to download Garmin Express to start syncing with Garmin Connect.</p>
<p>I downloaded the application and figured it would just be plug and play. It actually took me some time to get it going and to safe others from the same problem I thought I would quickly tell you how I did it. </p>
<p>When you start Garmin Express it showed me my ForeRunner 610, however the device fails to connect whatever you try. I finally decided to choose the option <strong>Remove the device from Garmin Express</strong>. Be sure to choose for the option to <strong>keep it in Garmin Connect</strong> from the popup that you get. At this point you can set your watch in Initial Pairing mode (Menu - System - Data Transfer - Initial Pairing) and add a new device to Garmin Express.</p>
<p>It should be found now and you can perform the suggested firmware updates as seen below.</p>

<p>Hope this helps you through the first steps of Garmin Express and the new Garmin Connect.</p>
<p>Happy running!</p>
