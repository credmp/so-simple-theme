This week I started following a training schedule specifically made for me by a coach. My ultimate goal, for now, is to run a half marathon at the end of the year. The coach made me a schedule up to june, as I am running the 14km of the <a href="http://almerecityrun.com/" target="_blank">Almere City Run</a> on june 15th. From there I will pick out a half marathon and train towards it.

<h2>Training schedule</h2>

The schedule builds up over 18 weeks to be primed for the Almere City Run. During the preparations I have 3 other races lined up, all of them 10km in length.
 
For this week my schedule has been:
<dl>
<dt>Tuesday 6:30am</dt>
<dd>A 30 minute run in heart rate zone 2. After measuring my heart rate we calculated my zone 2 to be between 136 and 152. Actually running within those bounds proved to be an exercise in restraint. I naturally want to run at full speed, but training at the lower zone has great benefits. <a href="http://d3multisport.com/heart-rate-training/zone-1-and-zone-2-training-explained/" target="_blank">Mike Ricci, an USAT Elite Coach, has a great write up on this subject</a>.</dd>

<dt>Friday 6am</dt>
<dd>A 60 minute interval training. For the first 20 minutes I needed to do a slow warm up. Then the pain began. In 8 intervals I needed to run at a pace of 4:45 min/km for 1 minute 55. This is much faster then my normal speed of 5:20 - 5:30 min/km and after the 4th interval I thought I would die, luckily I survived and completed all intervals as needed. I was very happy when I could just drop down to a slow run as a cooling down.

With this exercise the benefit of my Garmin watch was obvious. <a href="http://www.wickeddutch.com/2014/02/07/working-out-with-garmin/" title="Working out with Garmin" target="_blank">I programmed the workout into my watch</a> and it steered me perfectly throughout the entire exercise. I don't really see how you would do something like it without have a running watch.

The feature image of this post is in fact a photo I took just after my workout. It finally is starting to get a lot lighter in the mornings and I no longer feel as if I am running in the dead of night.
</dd>

<dt>Sunday 8:30am</dt>
<dd>A 60 minute run with an average heart rate of 140. This turned out to be much more difficult then I had previously imagined. Even though there was a nice sun out, the wind was still very cold. The first 18 minutes of the training were spent head on into the cold wind. My heart rate was quite erratic and I myself was very cold. After the 18 minute mark I turned out of the wind and I started to get really warm.

From that point on it turned out that at a heart rate of 140 I can maintain a speed of 8 min/km. This is much slower then I had anticipated. The course I had planned turned out to be way too long. So I took a shortcut home, but still I was left with 1km still to go when my 60 minutes were up. So I just restarted the workout and completed another 8 minute stretch.

As for the speed, it feels like something I can maintain for hours. Even though at the end I started to sweat somewhat it was not very exhausting.

Going the longer distances also poses some extra challenges. Suddenly you have to worry about nutrition and getting enough hydration. Instead of being out for about 30 minutes, as with a 5km to 7km race, I will be gone for 2 hours or more when doing the training.

<h2>Nutrition and running</h2>

A search on the internet yields lots of different answers to the question when to eat. According to one <a href="http://running.about.com/od/nutritionandhydration/f/eatontherun.htm" target="_blank">article I found on about.com</a> there actually is a rule of thumb:

<blockquote>
When you run for under 90 minutes, most of your energy comes from stored muscle glycogen. If you're running for longer than 90 minutes, the sugar in your blood and liver glycogen become more important because your stored muscle glycogen gets depleted. Fueling with carbs during your longer runs will prevent you from running out of energy and help boost your performance.

A basic rule of thumb is that you should be taking in about 100 calories after about an hour of running and then another 100 calories every 40-45 minutes after that. 
</blockquote>

An <a href="http://www.runnersworld.com/nutrition-runners/how-eat-during-long-runs" target="_blank">article on Runner's World</a> points out another vision on the need to eat:

<blockquote>In general, runners need to add in 30 to 60 grams of carbohydrate each hour that they are running longer than 75 minutes. But youâ€™ll need to start fueling earlier than 75 minutes into a run; by that time, your tank will be empty, and once you hit empty it is very hard to recover. Start taking in fuel within 30 minutes of hitting the pavement.</blockquote>

From my experience with running up to now I gather it is highly personal what you do and how you do it during a run. So I guess that also counts for the need for nutrition during a run. Runner's World also gives some tips on how to discover what works for you:

<blockquote>As you try out fuel during your training runs, keep track of how much you took in and how your body responded. Keep track of answers to questions like: Did you feel totally energized? Were you able to keep your pace constant but then hit the wall towards the end of a run? Did your stomach not agree with the fuel?</blockquote>

That store has a crazy amount of food supplements for anything from endurance sports to body building to weight loss. If you live in The Netherlands and are in need of supplements, check them out!

The nutrition doesn't start and end on the road. The time after a run is also very important, especially after a hard workout. When worked to the max your muscles need to recover from the massacre that you inflicted on them. The body does this on its own of course, but it is wise to help it by topping off the system with a shake. In dutch these are called eiwit shakes and I gather the english readers will know them as protein shakes (please correct me if I am wrong here!).

The body en fit shop seems to have a great deal on these shakes. On the recommendation of my colleague I went with the <a href="http://www.bodyenfitshop.nl/eiwittenwhey/whey-proteine/body-fit-sportsnutrition/whey-perfection/" target="_blank">Whey Perfection</a> shakes. It comes in a big ass bucket, as shown below. In the picture you also see the box in which the 24 sachets of energie gels are available.

I hope you found this article helpful. Other people have helped me get to grips with everything surrounding running and I think it is only fair to pay it forward. Happy running!
