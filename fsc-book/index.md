**Full Stack Clojure** is my first book. It is currently a massive work in
progress, but as it progresses you can read it, for free, here.

In **Full Stack Clojure** we will explore the depths of creating an
application that runs as a **Single Page Application** as well as a
**Mobile Application**, both being supported by a **Server Side**
back-end.

It is by no means an introduction to the **Clojure** programming
language, but a guide to get your hands really dirty creating
applications that you will love!
