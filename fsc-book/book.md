## Part I: The server Side

On the server side we will tackle the intricacies of setting up a
database to use for storing our data, including database
migrations. 

To communicate with the outside world we will be using both WebSockets and a REST interface. The REST interface will be fully testable due to the magic of Swagger-UI.

## Part II: The browser

Using ClojureScript and Re-Frame we will create a Single Page Application that will make the most your users love you! We will create a responsive, smooth user experience for our wonderful application. 

## Part III: The mobile device

In part 3, when we are still pumped full of energy from our victory over the web browsers, we will conquer an even greater enemy; the mobile device. 

We will create a front-end for our application that will run on both iOS as well as Android.
